This is a simple JSON parser that will print out a specifc part of the file.The program will ask for two inputs,
the JSON file you would like to parse and the name of the specifc part of the JSON file you would like to get.
The second input needs to be typed in exactly in order to find a match. Line 19 of the code will need to be changed
to match the keys in the JSON file. A test JSON called "distros.json" is provided.

Here is an example of how the program works:

Choose a json file: distros.json
Type in a name: "Fedora"
